# rDNS-Enum
Host enumeration via rDNS lookup

A simple script to enumerate all hosts in 10.0.0.0/8 for a network where rDNS is implemented.

I have created both bash and powershell versions -- the bash version requires you fill in the domain to the domain variable, but otherwise you can simply run them as is and they will continuously add results to a result file.
